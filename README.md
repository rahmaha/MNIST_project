## Warning
ðŸš© I'm currently new to AI so I'm trying a few projects in the supervised learning category. Some of the projects I've tried like this one use the MNIST dataset. This project still has a lot of flaws I hope if anyone sees it they will understand and I will be very happy if someone gives comments about my project. And I'm really sorry about my english, my native laguage is Indonesian. Thank you so much
